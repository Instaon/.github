**With AIOS, we connect devices and agents so value flows**

AIOS chips & protocols link devices and agents with identity, semantic registration, proactive service, and co-earning so value flows.

From embedded edge devices to ambient intelligence, we empower developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate intelligent agents with full-stack, cross-device compatibility.

## 🔭 What We Do
- 🧠 AIOS-ACRP — Capability Registration & Broadcast Protocol for multi-agent collaboration and co-earning.
- 🍪 AIOS-Chip — Proximity self-organizing networking for plug-and-play intelligence.
- 🌐 AIOS-Protocols — Register, discover, and communicate with agents via MCP and A2A standards.
- 🧰 Developer SDKs — Cross-platform tools for creating AI-enhanced applications and hardware experiences.
- 🪶 Extensible Interfaces — Seamless integration with sensors, displays, wearables, and smart environments.

> We believe in a future where every device is intelligent, and every user has their own AI team.
